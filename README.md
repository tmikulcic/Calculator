# Calculator

Project from The Odin Project boot camp that is focused on using Javascript logic to create a functioning Calculator.

This project taught me several things:
1. How to implement .map method
2. How to use innerText as an Input to perform number calculations

This is the project I was firstly afraid of doing but I made it suprisingly easy doing it the way I imagined it. It probably has some flaws and I intend of coming back to it to implement new functionalities.
